### PRO TIP: Use https://vscode.dev to write the programs if the PC does not have VS Code

## What?
A program that allows you to Compile (with NASM), Run (with DOSBox) and Debug (with AFD) .asm files by just double clicking on them.

## Why?
I'm Lazy.

## How?

1. Download and extract the `labsetup.zip` from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/HusnainTaj/afdbox/releases).
2. Run the `afdbox.exe` once
3. Right-Click on any `.asm` file and select `afdbox.exe` in the `Open With` context menu

## To always open `.asm` files using `afdbox.exe`
1. Right click on a `.asm` file and open its Properties
2. Click on the "Change" Button next to the "Opens with" text
3. Select `afdbox.exe` 

## Note
- If you have moved `labsetup` folder after running `afdbox.exe` once, you will have to re-run `afdbox.exe` for the program to work again.
